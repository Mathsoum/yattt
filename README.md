# YATTT
Yet Another Time Tracking Tool

YATTT is a standalone time-tracking tool for your personal and professional daily uses.  
It does not have any Cloud-based feature, therefore it does not allow you to sync your time tracking tables between your various devices.  
This also means that you do not need any account with any service provider in order to use YATTT. However, you can export your time-tracking tables in order to import them into another instance of YATTT. From there, it's is as simple as a shared network directory or a rsync command to synchronise your time-tracking data across devices.
This system allow you to reuse any existing Cloud-absed storage service if you really need to.
